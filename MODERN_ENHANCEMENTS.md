## 🚀 How to Use

### Option A: Apply to All Pages (Recommended)
The enhancements are already configured in `_config.yml`:
```yaml
site-css:
  - "/assets/css/custom-modern.css"

site-js:
  - "/assets/js/custom-modern.js"
```

This applies the modern styles to all pages automatically! ✅

### Option B: Use New Layouts Selectively

**For the homepage:**
```yaml
---
layout: home-modern
title: هناء عبد الخالق
---
```

**For individual posts:**
```yaml
---
layout: post-modern
title: رؤى محدبة
---
```

### Option C: Mix and Match
- Keep `layout: home` or `layout: post` for original design
- The CSS/JS enhancements will still apply, just more subtly
